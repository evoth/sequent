## TODO
- Destructors?
- Add way to reset state
- Make it good
- Keep using smart pointers instead of raw pointer nonsense
  - Try to get rid of references as well where appropriate?
- Add disconnect functions for everything and make use of cameraConnected variables (e.g. stop keepalive if not isConnected)
  - Or have an isConnected member of Device class
- Ability to enable/disable live view for M200 (overheating prevention)
- Add way to see/request more logs
  - Logs can be accumulated on client when connected
  - Can just request last N logsin readAction() instead of having to open and close the file literally hundreds of times
- Implement keep alive (or just async WebSockets) to prevent network blocking timeout bug thing?
- Improve GPS time sync
- Replace the word "state" with "status" as necessary
